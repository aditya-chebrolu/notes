# Webpack vs Vite: From Dev Server Start to Page Request

## Webpack

1. **Run Dev Server (`npm run dev`)**
   - Webpack reads `webpack.config.js`
   - Builds dependency graph from entry point(s)
   - Bundles all modules upfront

2. **Dev Server Starts**
   - Webpack Dev Server initializes
   - Holds bundled files in memory

3. **Browser Requests Page**
   - User navigates to `localhost:port`
   - Browser sends request for HTML

4. **Server Responds**
   - Dev server sends HTML file
   - HTML includes references to bundled JS

5. **Browser Loads JavaScript**
   - Browser requests bundled JS file(s)
   - Server sends complete bundle(s)

6. **Application Renders**
   - Browser executes received bundle(s)
   - Full application becomes interactive

7. **Subsequent Changes**
   - Webpack rebundles affected modules
   - HMR updates specific parts without full reload

## Vite

1. **Run Dev Server (`npm run dev`)**
   - Vite reads `vite.config.js`
   - Starts dev server immediately (no initial bundling)

2. **Browser Requests Page**
   - User navigates to `localhost:port`
   - Browser sends request for HTML

3. **Server Responds**
   - Vite sends HTML file
   - HTML includes `<script type="module">` for entry point

4. **Browser Requests Modules**
   - Browser requests main JavaScript module
   - Subsequent `import` statements trigger more requests

5. **Vite Transforms Modules**
   - Intercepts each module request
   - Transforms files on-the-fly (e.g., TS to JS, JSX to JS)
   - Sends individual transformed modules to browser

6. **Application Renders Progressively**
   - Browser executes modules as they arrive
   - Application becomes interactive in stages

7. **Subsequent Changes**
   - Vite invalidates only changed module(s)
   - HMR updates specific modules without full reload

## Key Differences in Dev Experience

1. **Initial Load Time**
   - Webpack: Longer initial build time, faster subsequent page loads
   - Vite: Near-instant server start, slightly longer initial page load

2. **Bundling Approach**
   - Webpack: Bundles everything upfront
   - Vite: No bundling in development, serves ES modules directly

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Webpack: Works with older browsers (after bundling)
   - Vite: Requires browsers with ES module support

4. **Performance on Large Projects**
   - Webpack: May slow down with project size
   - Vite: Maintains fast performance regardless of project size

5. **HMR Speed**
   - Both support HMR
   - Vite's HMR can be faster due to granular module updates
